# Israeli Flight Analysis- An Interactive Dashboard
Following the decline of the global Covid-19 pandamic and as a result, the canceling of airtravel restrictions, the Israeli Airports Authority (IAA) is facing a surge in flights this summer.
This analysis is based on a 24 hours timeframe data (between 25/7/2022 and 26/7/2022), that was retrieved from the Israeli Datasets website (data.gov.il).
The first part of the analysis examines what were the canceled destinations and which airlines canceled their flights.
The second Part focuses on the delayed flights- what were the top 5 destinations and top 5 airlines with the highest average delay time and different total delay distributions.
